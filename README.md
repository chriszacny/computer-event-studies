# computer-event-studies

## What

This is a repo for self-study of computing event systems. I am starting with basic "Observer pattern" eventing as implemented in two standard programming languages (Python and Golang) and will be moving into messaging systems (Enterprise Integration Patterns) and signal programming.

## Why

I feel there hasn't been a comprehensive study on the topic of events and messaging implementations in the modern space (Kubernetes, Docker, Message Buses, etc) and really am just looking to wrap my head around what is out there as we move into 2020 and beyond.

## Topics

### Eventing in Programming Languages
